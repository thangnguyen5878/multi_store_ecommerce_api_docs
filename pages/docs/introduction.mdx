Welcome to the official documentation for the Multi Store E-Commerce API. This RESTful API powers our multi-vendor e-commerce platform, allowing developers to integrate with our system for various operations including user management, product listings, order processing, and more.

## API Overview

The Multi Store E-Commerce API is organized around REST principles. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

## Authentication

The API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. To access protected endpoints, you need to include the token in the token header of your requests.

## Error Handling

The API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request:

- `2xx` - Success
- `4xx` - Error that failed given the information provided (e.g., bad request, not found)
- `5xx` - Server errors

Error responses include a JSON object with an `error` field that provides additional information about the error.

Example error response:
```json
{
  "error": "Invalid input parameters",
  "msg": "Product name is required"
}
```

## Getting Started

To start using the API, you need to:

1. Register a user account using the `/api/signup` endpoint
2. Authenticate using the `/api/signin` endpoint to obtain a JWT token
3. Include this token in subsequent requests that require authentication

Detailed information about each endpoint, including request parameters, response formats, and examples, can be found in the API Reference section of this documentation.
